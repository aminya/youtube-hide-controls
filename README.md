# Hide YouTube video controls

Get the add-on from:
- [Mozilla add-on page](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/hide-youtube-controls/).
- [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-youtube-fullscreen-c/akkdefghgcakdgkmakeajmijjhlcofmk)

Does YouTube leave the video controls visible for longer than you like? Do you want to have a hotkey that toggles the controls?
This add-on gives you the tools to change that.

You can:
- Hide the video controls when you move the cursor to any border
- Toggle the controls when you press the configurable hotkey

In the add-on settings you can configure the individual sides as well as the hotkey.

If you experience any issues, please let me know [here](https://github.com/nralbrecht/youtube-hide-controls/issues).
